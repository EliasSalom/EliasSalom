### Iâ€™m Software Engenner and web Developer :point_down:
with a vast array of knowledge in many different front-end and back-end languages, responsive frameworks, databases, and best code practices. My objective is simply to be the best web developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do. and I believe that my understanding of problem-solving and complex algorithms are also skills that have and will continue to contribute to my overall success as a developer.

 - **By Day** I Coding: Python, C/C++, unafraid of assembly, and Rust and C# are growing on me. I don't always develop database-driven
   applications, but when I do, I prefer PostgreSQL.
 - **By night** I Coding: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java, and more. I've dabbled in hardware projects with Arduino and raspberry pi boards.

I'm a Linux guy, a Git fanboy, a fan of Debian and its derivatives, and usually a cheerleader for solving problems with free/open-source software. I've reverse-engineered a couple of interesting protocols and written cleanroom documentation.
In terms of human languages, I speak Arabic, Hebrew, and English.

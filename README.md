### Iâ€™m Software Engenner and web Developer :point_down:

 - **By Day** I Coding: Python, C/C++, unafraid of assembly, and Rust and C# are growing on me. I don't always develop database-driven
   applications, but when I do, I prefer PostgreSQL.
 - **By night** I Coding: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java, and more. I've dabbled in hardware projects with Arduino and raspberry pi boards.
